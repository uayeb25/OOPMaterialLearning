## Project Context
This is a React + TypeScript + Vite educational visualization project for MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline concepts.

## Key Requirements
- Use Framer Motion for smooth animations between pipeline steps
- Create interactive components that explain $lookup, $match, $addFields operations
- Focus on educational clarity over complex design
- Use TypeScript for better code quality and IDE support
- Create reusable components for database collections and documents
- Implement step-by-step navigation similar to a presentation

## Code Style
- Use functional components with hooks
- Prefer named exports over default exports
- Use descriptive variable names that reflect MongoDB concepts
- Add comments for complex animation logic
- Follow React best practices for state management

## MongoDB Context
- Working with candy store collections: "catalogs" and "catalogtypes"
- Demonstrating how $lookup creates JOIN operations
- Explaining field matching between collections
- Showing data transformation through pipeline stages
